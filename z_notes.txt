instead of using const app = express()
we can use const router = express.Router();

ex. 
router.get("/users/all", async (req, res)=>{

})

router.get("/users/new", async (req, res)=>{

})

we use router to make our code neat and clean
we make routes folder 
where we created user.js file
so every api with /user will be in it and we export this file in app.js
the main use of router is you just specify the common route i.e /user in our case and you dont have to write it everytime

ex.
in app.js
we import our route file
and use middleware

import userRouter from "./routes/user.js")
app.use("/users", userRouter)

now in router user.js file we just write

router.get("/all", async (req, res)=>{

})

router.get("/new", async (req, res)=>{

})

//**similar we create model folder for storing models i.e mongoose model
//we create controller folder for storing function
//we use this folder in our main app.js file by importing which makes app.js file clean and neatly structured
